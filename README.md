# Exquisite Stories (Ironhack 2023 - Dev web - Project 2)

## Why do we choose this app?

First, we had the idea of doing some sort of online diary then the teachers improved our idea and directed us to a story app so users could write, edit, delete and share stories with other users from the community who like to write.

## Key features

- CRUD on the chapters of a story.
- CR on the stories.
- Mongoose models:  one for stories, one for chapters.
- Middlewares authentification.
- Seeds to populate the db.
- Hbs for the styling + CSS

## What's next?

- Add more criteria, instruction and checking steps to sign-up (email and number, symbol, capital letters restrictions, etc.).
- Improve our skills with seeds and routes.
- Add a field to upload his user image to display it on the app.
- Add a delete function for the finished stories to be able to remove it.
_ Improve the design to fit more with the theme of the app about writing.
- Make it responsive.
